### Quick Project Summaries

**Lead Gen AI Agent**  
AI-powered system for researching potential leads and generating smart outreach messages. Designed to be compliant and customizable.

Link: https://lead-gen-ai-frontend-pmb3-pghknxbbh-tatiana-brimms-projects.vercel.app/

**Job Seeker AI**  
AI agent that applies to jobs based on user's resume and preferences - like a smart job-hunting buddy. 

Description
JobSeekerAI is an automated job-search assistant that scrapes job listings, generates tailored resumes and cover letters, and streamlines the entire application workflow.

Version 1 is live as an open beta prototype, while Version 2 is being rebuilt with a new JavaScript + Python microservices stack, full technical documentation, system diagrams, TDD and DDD patterns, and an AP (Availability + Partition Tolerance)-focused architecture.

Why I Built It
I watched family, classmates, and friends struggle to balance school, work, family, and the brutal job market and I wanted to build something that actually helps.

JobSeekerAI is my way of making the process less overwhelming by giving people automation, structure, and intelligent tools they can rely on.

Version 1 is fully live as an open beta prototype. provide link: https://jobseekerai.nevaratech.com/


**BrimmBot (Me!)**  
 

BrimmBot is my long-term personal AI assistant — an agentic chatbot designed to appear across my entire ecosystem of projects.

Version 1 started as a simple script that could read from a Word document.

Version 2 introduces short-term memory, better reasoning, and integrations inside JobSeekerAI, Portfolio V1, and Portfolio V2 (even when the chatbot appears under different names, the core is BrimmBot).

BrimmBot will continue growing as I grow as a developer. Over time, it will evolve into a fully agentic AI capable of multi-step reasoning, task automation, and efficiency improvements that follow Green AI initiatives.

**AI Driven Analytic Healthcare Dashboard**  
Real-world healthcare dataset cleaned and visualized with dashboards. 

This project began as a 50,000+ row Excel dataset that I fully cleaned and wrangled to strengthen my data engineering fundamentals.

It’s now evolving into a full healthcare analytics dashboard with AI-assisted insights, SAM.gov API ingestion, and a roadmap toward an EHR simulation focused on safe, compliant AI integration in regulated environments.

Why I Built It
I wanted to build something that reflects real healthcare challenges, not hype. Many hospitals still rely on legacy SOAP-based systems, outdated interfaces, and siloed datasets.

I built this project to simulate how a modern healthcare organization might transition from SOAP to REST APIs while introducing AI ethically and responsibly. It reinforces my background in health informatics while showing how AI can be safely introduced into high-regulation environments.

**Calculator V2 AI**  
The second version in my calculator app series, rebuilt from scratch with clean architecture, modern tooling, and real AI integration. Each version of this series is built in a different language or stack, and each one adds new features so I can keep leveling up as a developer.

This version includes:

Python OOP backend
FastAPI for the API layer
JavaScript frontend
AI-powered Quiz Mode using OpenAI
Unit tests for calculator logic + API + AI quiz routes
CI pipeline (pytest, flake8, black)
I’ll continue expanding this series as I grow — adding new languages, architectures, and real-world features.
 

**Weather APP**  
Real-world small weather app to test APIs. Rebuilt in Nodejs. 

**Tic-Tac-Toe**  

A real-time multiplayer Tic Tac Toe game built to practice WebSockets and event-driven backend architecture.

Players can connect, make moves, and see updates instantly without refreshing the page. This project demonstrates how real-time communication works in modern applications such as games, chat apps, and collaborative tools.

Why I Built It
I wanted a fun, lightweight way to learn how WebSockets work under the hood.

Building a real-time game gave me a practical way to implement event listeners, room logic, state synchronization, and backend messaging patterns that appear in full-scale systems. I also wanted to get a glimspe into gaming development.

It will be done before Decemeber 2025.

**Cloud-Project**  

This project demonstrates how real applications are deployed and managed in the cloud using AWS best practices. It includes IAM role setup, secure bucket management, a deployed application layer, and a proper architecture layout showing how production systems scale.

The purpose is to show practical cloud engineering—not just theory—by actually deploying services rather than simulating them locally.

Why I Built It
I wanted hands-on experience building and deploying systems the way cloud engineers do in real companies. Instead of sticking to local development, I wanted to learn IAM permissions, EC2 configuration, S3 storage patterns, and network control in a real cloud environment.

### Project README Files

Each project has a dedicated README file with comprehensive information. When a user asks about a specific project, you should:

1. **Reference the appropriate README file** for detailed technical information
2. **Provide a conversational summary** based on README content
